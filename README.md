👋 Hi there! I’m Anelisa Charlotte Mhlamo.

  - 👩‍💻 I’m a software engineer with a deep passion for backend development. While I enjoy exploring the full spectrum of software development—front-end, web development, and more—backend systems are where I truly thrive.
  - 🌱 Currently expanding my knowledge in data engineering and web development—the challenges and endless possibilities keep me inspired.
  - 📚 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me:
      - Immersed in a biography or self-help book.
      - Serving in my local church.
      - Exploring YouTube for fun and insightful content.
      - Dreaming about hiking (my current life setting makes it tricky to go on my hikes, but the love remains!).
  - 😄 Pronouns: she/her
